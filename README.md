# canvos-classic
the really old version of that one desktop environment no one knows, made by the people no one know, created by the alt no one knows

- this is the old version of canvos canvos that simply drew a hecc ton of rectangles.

- this is no longer supported, and there is no guide.

- this should not be to hard to figure out.
