# canvos-classic
the really old version of that one desktop environment no one knows, made by the people no one know, created by the alt no one knows

this is the old version of canvos that simply drew a hecc ton of rectangles. most things are not functional and it seems to run in 720p.

how to install:

 * download and extract the zip file
 
 * install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/
 
 * go to the directory of canvos classic in your terminal of choice and type `node server.js`
 
 * in a web browser, go to localhost/index.html and enter fullscreen (usually by pressing F11 or the corresponding key to your OS/browser)
 
 * enjoy your nonfunctional canvos

i actually wasn't part of the process of creating this so i literally just uploaded an extracted zip no one had touched in months.
